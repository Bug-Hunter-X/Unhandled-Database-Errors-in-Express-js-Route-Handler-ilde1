# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for database queries within route handlers.  Improper error handling can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem
The original code lacks proper error handling for cases where the database query fails or returns no results. This can cause the application to crash or return unexpected responses to the client.

## Solution
The solution involves adding comprehensive error handling to check for database errors and the absence of results.  Appropriate HTTP status codes are used to inform the client of the error.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
4. Run `node bug.js` and `node bugSolution.js` to see the difference.

Note: This example assumes you have a database connection setup. Replace `db.getUserById` with your actual database interaction function.
